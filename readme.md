### Description
This application was created for users to create a record of their
collection of sake and show them off online. Besides notes and details
on the bottles they post, users can also share an image of their bottle.

As a CRUD app, users can create, read, update and delete the bottles 
they post to the app. Users can also clone the bottles of other users
as a way of saving time in posting their own, or perhaps just as a way
of keeping track of a bottle which they find interesting.

The Collection Gallery, accessed via the 'Browse Collections' link in the
navbar or footer, is the page where users can view other users' collections.

Using Flask-Babel, the app also supports Japanese browser locales so that Japanese
users can also make use of the app with ease. I did most of the Japanese 
translation myself, but Mirei Ikushima deserves special thanks for proofreading and
improving the translation.
